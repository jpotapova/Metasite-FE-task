# Task for a candidate frontend developer

### HTML/CSS
Implement the presented design (appreciate the attention to the details) using HTML5 and CSS3.  
Fonts used in the project:  
- Open Sans  
- FontAwesome  

Download the design files from [here](https://contactify-api.herokuapp.com/api/download/design).

### JS
Display contact list from the API (documentation can be found [here](https://contactify-api.herokuapp.com/docs)).
P.S. The initial load may take some time to start.

We will give additional points for:
- data sorting functionality by name (sort must be two-ways);
- data filtering by name / city / activity;
- functionality of displaying the data of the selected contact in the viewing area (separate loading of data according to the selected ID from the API would be an advantage);
- table columns hide / show functionality;
- code formatters and linters;
- React / Angular and correct usage of its API ([react](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)/[angular](https://angular.io/api)).

### We will evaluate:
- functional and visual fulfilment of the task;
- project architecture;
- demonstrated technical knowledge;
- compliance with code standards;
- scalability (event though it's a small project, build it as it was meant to grow into a big one!).

### Requirements for the given result:
- support only the latest version of Chrome;
- responsive design version is not required;
- if you know some nice library that can make this task easier, feel free to use it!

### Task submission:
The results must be submitted to jobs@metasite.net.  
Source code must be placed in public version control platform (such as github, bitbucket and etc.).
